# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Code Refactor

## Description

With the object of making the code accessible, I cleaned up and improved the html and css in this file as follows:

* Added appropriate page title and fixed minor broken code.
* Changed divs to reflect semantic elements including header, nav, main, section, article, and footer.
* Added alt tags to the images in the html. For the hero image which was included in css, I added a span with img attribute and aria-label.
* Added notes to easily distinguish between areas of html and css.
* Reorganized css to reflect the sequence of the html code.
* Consolidated duplicate css within the section classes by applying them to the articles within the parent element class and removing the extra class attributes in those articles.
